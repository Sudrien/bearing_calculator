Bearing and Distance Calculator
(C) 2025 Sudrien MIT

Calculates the bearing between two sets of longitude and latitude. Will also give a distance as a percentage of equatorial length. 

If given a planet size (Earth, Moon and Sun have preset buttons) The distance will be a km/Mm measurement.

Also gives a preview of the direction and distance. Still trying to figure out the best projection. 

Uses [d3/d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [d3/d3-geo-projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection)

PWA should work for offline use. Live at [https://bearing.sudrien.net/](https://bearing.sudrien.net/)
